## 💬 Questions to Help You Decide

1. **What excites you most?** (AI, Cloud, IoT, Mobile?)

## 🚀 MY FINAL ADVICE

**Start with OdooMate (#1) because:**
- You have the domain expertise
- You have potential customers already
- It's affordable to build
- AI is hot right now (easier to raise funding if needed)
- It's a wedge product - you can expand to other ERP systems later

**Build MVP in 90 days, launch beta, get 10 paying customers in Month 4-6.**

If you get traction, you'll know you're onto something. If not, pivot to #8 (WhatsApp Suite) which has lower barrier to entry.
